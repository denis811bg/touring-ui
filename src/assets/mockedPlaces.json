          "text": "Visiting Milan Duomo with my family, including two kids, was an overall okay experience, but a few aspects left us with mixed feelings.\nThe cathedral itself is a breathtaking masterpiece, with its intricate architecture and stunning design. Our kids were fascinated by the grandeur of the exterior and the history behind this iconic landmark. However, our enthusiasm was somewhat dampened by the extensive security measures at the entrance. While safety is undoubtedly important, the level of scrutiny felt exaggerated, making the entry process a bit tedious, especially with children in tow.\nOne major downside during our visit was the ongoing renovation work. It impacted the overall ambiance and obstructed some of the views, diminishing the full splendor of this historical site.\nAdditionally, the cost of going up in the tower with the elevator was a bit steep (17 EUR / person if I remember correctly). We opted to skip the tower ascent due to the high cost, which was disappointing considering it's one of the main attractions.\nOn a positive note, the interior of the cathedral was awe-inspiring, and exploring the surrounding square was a delightful experience. The vibrant atmosphere and surrounding shops and cafes added to the charm of the visit.\nIn conclusion, Milan Duomo is undoubtedly a must-visit, but potential visitors should be aware of the renovation work and be prepared for the associated challenges. The security measures could be more streamlined, and the pricing for additional experiences like the tower ascent may need reconsideration, particularly for families with children.",

Walking through the historic passageways, we felt transported to a bygone era of grandeur and sophistication. The kids were fascinated by the intricate mosaics, high glass ceilings, and the general sense of opulence that permeated the surroundings.\nHowever, for a family on a budget, the allure of the luxury shops and designer boutiques was bittersweet. While window shopping was enjoyable, the reality was that most of the items on display were way beyond our financial reach. It's essential for families to be aware that this is more of an experience destination than a budget-friendly shopping spot.\nOn a positive note, the atmosphere was vibrant, and the Galleria is not just about shopping. We took a moment to enjoy a coffee in one of the historic cafes, soaking in the ambiance and people-watching, which added a pleasant touch to our visit.\nIn summary, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is a must-visit for its architectural marvel and historical significance. Families should approach it with the understanding that the shopping experience might be more aspirational than practical, but the overall ambiance and cultural richness make it a worthwhile stop, even if you're not planning to splurge on designer goods.",
